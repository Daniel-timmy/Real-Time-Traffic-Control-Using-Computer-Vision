This file details how the whole application works.

The arguments.py file is used to provide the program with the needed inputs such as the camera feed feed
and also the destination to store the resulting video.

source_video_path(arguments.py): this is the source of the video feed for the drone algorithm
camera0-3(arguments.py): these represent the sources for the four camera algorithm

These variables must be change to the source of your video feed

The program is set to run using the four camera mode by default using "python main.py"
to change it to the drone mode use "python main.py --mode=aerial"
